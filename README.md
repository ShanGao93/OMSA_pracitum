Local Machine Testing
Playing around with signals.ipynb is the first notebook I used to get familar with the chicken audio data.

Cough Detector sgao.ipynb is the notebook from which I developed my first local chicken cough detector.

Classifier folder contains the two functions asked for the task of developing a cough detector.
It contains two functions: train_cough_detector and run_cough_detector.
samll_set folder contains all  data I used. (I deleted all of them to not reveal confidential information)

SageMaker Development
Cough Detector pdf and html is the sagemaker notebook I tried to test various models for detecting chicken cough.

Chirp Detector pdf and html is the sagemaker notebook I used to train all trianing data on chicken chirp.

Chirp Detector day pdf and html is the sagemaker notebook I used to train the first two nights of data, report the models' performance on test set data,creating chirp counter per minute, and plotting the number of chirps over night

Chirp Counter pdf and html is the sagemaker notebook I used to test draw the labelled chirp data.

Unsave Chirp Counter Code from SageMaker.ipynb is the copy I made for part of Chirp Detector day becasue the kernel suddenly died when I run the notebook.
